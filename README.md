# Automating legacy system maintenace and workflows

## Background
It is no secret that legacy systems are seen as critical and brittle.

While they are the backbone of mission critical transactions, people roll their eyes at the thought of black and green screens - the very foundation of computers. 

These systems process millions of transactions a day to support global industries. How do we keep a legacy application moving at 2025 speed when their very foundation relies heavily on manual input?

Enter: Python.

## Imagine this
Let's say you run a small furniture business. You founded the business in 1985 and have been running the shop for 40 years. You have a small application that you use to manage, process, and close orders.
It's not the fanciest or equipped with the latest features, but it gets the job done. Plus, you don't have to pay a subscription every month to keep it running.

Let's say you work with different carriers to ship your products worldwide. In the shipping world, someone pays for goods to move. Like when you go the UPS or USPS store and pay to send your aunt a shoe she left at your gathering last weekend.
Let's say in your small furniture business world, you pay for for the shipping and don't pass the fee onto your customer.

When you first started your furniture business, your little application was able to keep up with customer demand with ease.
But ever since you went viral on social media and sales began picking up, you have been running into all sorts of errors.

You've seen many, but a few that stand out:
- Carrier rate not loaded (even though you just loaded 500)
- Cannot populate tracking number (even though you triple checked the setup and docs)
- Shipment routing to wrong carrier (I just fixed it last night!)

Because these errors are holding up shipping oeprations, customers are complaning and you are at your wits end.
The application works, but it is hard to maintain. You've tried getting your teammates to learn it to try and delegate, but they don't want to touch it with a 10-foot pole.

To bring this situation back to reality... this is an issue many people and organizations experience when legacy systems are baked into their business. 

## Solutions, Methods, Tools

So, what do we do about it?

Legacy sysytems are not documented extensively with detail available with the click of a button or a simple Google search.

But there are a variety of methods to tackle this problem.

1. Create code that will handle the manual entries for you
   - Automate the process, so the computer handles it. Operator will be focused on debugging, troubleshooting, and aligning code with screen logic.
   - Use whichever language you are most comfortable with. Or learn one you are the least apprehensive toward.
   - Start somewhere. Be okay with failing. Just remember to get up.r

2. Automate any data cleaning steps prior to the data load process
   - Use Excel formulas to your advantage.

3. Prioritize and perserverence
   - Sort by what to tackle first.
   - Automate the manual processes that take the most time.
   - Consider business significance / impact.
