# Automating legacy system maintenance and workflows

## Background
It is no secret that legacy systems are seen as critical and brittle.

While they are the backbone of mission critical transactions, people roll their eyes at the thought of black and green screens - the very foundation of computers. 

These systems process millions of transactions a day to support global industries. How do we keep a legacy application moving at 2025 speed when their very foundation relies heavily on manual input?

Enter: Python.

## Imagine this
Let's say you run a small furniture business. You founded the business in 1985 and have been running the shop for 40 years. You have a small application that you use to manage, process, and close orders.
It's not the fanciest or equipped with the latest features, but it gets the job done. Plus, you don't have to pay a subscription every month to keep it running.

In the shipping world, someone pays for goods to move. Like when you go to the UPS or USPS store and pay to send your aunt a shoe she left at your gathering last weekend.
Let's say you work with different carriers to ship your products worldwide. In your furniture business world, you pay for the shipping and don't pass the fee onto your customers.

When you first started your furniture business, your application was able to keep up with customer demand with ease.
But ever since you went viral on social media and sales began picking up, your application has been running into all sorts of errors.

You've seen many, but a few that stand out:
- Carrier rate not loaded (even though you just loaded 500)
- Cannot populate tracking number (even though you triple checked the setup and docs)
- Shipment routing to wrong carrier (I just fixed it last night!)

Because these errors are holding up shipping operations, customers are complaining and you are at your wits end.
The application works, but it is hard to maintain. You've tried encouraging your teammates to learn it as well, but they don't want to touch it with a 10-foot pole.

To bring this situation back to reality... this is an issue many people and organizations experience when legacy systems are baked into their infrastructure. 

## Solutions, Methods, Tools

...so what do we do about it?

Legacy systems are not documented extensively with detail available via the click of a button or a simple Google search.

But there are a variety of methods to tackle this problem.

1. Create code that will handle the manual entries for you
   - Automate the process, so the computer handles it. Operator will be focused on debugging, troubleshooting, and aligning code with screen logic.
   - Use whichever language you are most comfortable with. Or learn one you are the least apprehensive toward.
   - Start somewhere. Be okay with failing. Just remember to keep going.

2. Automate any data cleaning steps prior to the data load process
   - You can start at spreadsheets or use software from the beginning.
   - Use Excel formulas to your advantage.

3. Prioritize and perservere
   - Sort by what process to tackle first.
   - Automate the manual processes that take the most time.
   - Consider business significance / impact.

4. The Test Environment is your friend
   - Don't be afriad to dive deep in Test.
   - Stretch the system with edge cases (maybe check with the engineering team first).
   - Brainstorm scenarios and simulate them.

5. Appreciate the system, flow, and connectivity
   - Legacy is a piece of history that can be interacted with and observed. 
   - Learn the customer facing side and what's under the hood.
   - Understand the reality (maintenance vs application development).
